First of all, I want to thank Prof. Dr. Uwe Baumgarten for making
this bachelor thesis possible in the first place.
I am also very grateful for the support of Sebastian Eckl and Alexander Weidinger for their continued support of my work.
Thanks to the people of the RISC-V and RISCV-BOOM mailing lists,
especially to Bruce Hoult, Farzad Farshchi, Abraham Gonzalez and Andrew Waterman as they
greatly helped me to understand the RISC-V ISA and the Rocket Chip SoC generator better.
Thanks a lot to Tabea Pape for carefully reading my work and making insightful comments.
