\chapter{Future work}\label{chap:future_work}
The future work for this thesis will include the implementation
of the Checkpoint/Restore concept which was presented earlier.
As the RISC-V architecture is steadily growing, this might be
a worthwhile task for future processors and applications.
In subsection \ref{subsec:thoughs_impl} we already
discovered, that the memory system of a Rocket core is more
complex as previously anticipated.
We have found two ways to implement the concept of which
the first one was expensive and the second one contained
a performance penalty. For the future work, the author
recommends the second option, as firstly the performance penalty
only hits when a checkpoint is created, and secondly,
the performance should only be mildly impaired as
only small sets of data need to be renewed, and the
resolution of page tables is, in general, a very accelerated
task.
