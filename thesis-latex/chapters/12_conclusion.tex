\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:conclusion}
Looking back at the beginning of this thesis, the journey through
Xilinx ARM-FPGA boards, binary files, the RISC-V ISA and the many
RISC-V implementations was very interesting.
The Rocket-chip was complicated at first glance, but
presents a unique and modern way of solving hardware design
problems. Chisel and its base language Scala allow the
use of reusable, highly configurable classes which later turn
into synthesizable Verilog.

The original goal of finding and implementing a real-time capable
Checkpoint/Restore mechanism was not fully reached, as the
setup of the Xilinx boards at the start of the thesis took
time. However, this thesis found a new approach to
Checkpoint/Restore systems and presented it in chapter \ref{chap:concept}.
